# PRINCIPAL COMPONENET ANALYSIS (PCA)

PCA is a method used to reduce number of variables in your data by extracting important one from a large pool.
It reduces the dimension of your data with the aim of retaining as much information as possible.

# About the dataset

This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass.
It was obtained from the StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston), and has been used extensively
throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms. However, these comparisonswere primarily done outside of Delve 
and are thus somewhat suspect. The dataset is small in size with only 506 cases.
